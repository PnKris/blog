## Data structures and algorithms

- Basic data structures

**Data Structure**

데이터구조는 정돈된 데이터의 집합으로 특정 방식으로 데이터를 넣고, 꺼낼 수 있게 합니다.

**ADT (Abstract Data Type)**

"Data" + "Operations on the data" => "A Data Type"

Data Type은 해당 프로그래밍 언어가 정의해놓은 Primitive Data Type = Concrete Data Type과 Abstract Data Type으로 나뉜다.

**Array**

인덱스를 이용하여 데이터를 삽입하거나 참조합니다.

create, retrieve, store operation이 있습니다.

인덱스를 안다면 1 step에 데이터를 찾을 수 있지만, 데이터 사이에 삽입을 하려면 먼저 데이터들을 옮겨야 합니다.

**Linked-List**

index 대신 다음 node의 주소를 들고 있게 합니다. 데이터는 선형 탐색으로 찾아야 하지만 삽입과 제거는 O(1)에 가능합니다.

C로 구현한다면 데이터 삽입과 삭제는 Malloc과 free를 반복하며 하게 됩니다.

Singly-Linked, Doubly-Linked

**Stack**

LIFO(Last-In/First-Out) Data Structure

array나 linked-list로 구현합니다.

array로 만드려면 간단히 array 하나와 top-index만 가지고 있으면 됩니다.

**Queue**

FIFO(First-In/First-Out) Data Structure

array를 통한 구현이 stack보다 복잡합니다.

queue의 item들을 한 array에 담고 enqueue, dequeue에 전체 array를 통째로 옮겨가게 만들면 쉽지만 O(n)이 됩니다.
아니면, front와 rear(꼬리) index를 따로 들고 있게 합니다. 이렇게 하면 enqueue/dequeue가 반복될수록 array의 앞이 비고 뒤로 밀리는데,
Circular Array 개념을 이용하여 해결할 수 있습니다.

**Priority Queue**

array를 priority마다 준비하던가, 한 array에 enqueue 할 때 올바른 위치로 들어가도록 합니다.
array나 linked-list를 이용하면 삽입이 O(n)인데, heap을 이용하면 삽입과 삭제가 모두 O(log(n))이 됩니다.
